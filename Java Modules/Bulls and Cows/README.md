Let's start by reminding ourselves how the game goes. There are two players: the first writes a secret 4-digit code using different digits, and the second has to guess it. At each turn, the second player writes a 4-digit number that they think might be the correct answer. Then, the first player grades that answer using bulls and cows as a notation. If a digit in the given answer matches a digit and its position in the code, it's called a "bull." If a given digit appears in the code but it position doesn't match, then it's called a "cow." The first player reveals how many bulls and cows there are. The information is general; in other words, it isn't bound to any particular digit. For example:  

The code is 4931.  
The answer is 1234.  
The grade is 1 bull and 2 cows.  
  
Here, 3 is a bull, 1 and 4 are cows. If all the digits are bulls, the secret code has been guessed and the game ends. If not, the game continues and the second player tries again.
