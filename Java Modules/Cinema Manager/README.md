    * If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
    * In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows, and the second half is the rest 5 rows.
